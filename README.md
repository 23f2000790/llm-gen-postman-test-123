# Hello Postman

## Summary
This is a very simple static web page that displays the text "Hello from Postman!". It serves as a basic example of a web application.

## Setup
This is a static site and does not require any special setup or build process. To view the page, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

1. Save the `index.html` file to your local machine.
2. Open your preferred web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
3. Go to `File > Open File` (or use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+O` or `Cmd+O`) and select the `index.html` file.

Alternatively, you can drag and drop the `index.html` file directly into your browser window.

## Code Explanation
- `index.html`: This is the main and only file of the project. It contains the standard HTML structure (`<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`) and an `<h1>` tag displaying the message "Hello from Postman!".
